4. **Administrative Flow**: Admin Login → Dashboard → Content Management

### **Wireframe Development Process**
#### **Initial Sketches**:
- **Low-fidelity wireframes** created for core user journeys
- **Mobile-first approach** ensuring responsive design from conception
- **Iterative refinement** based on user story mapping

#### **Wireframe Evolution**:
- **Desktop Layout**: Focus on content hierarchy and navigation clarity
- **Tablet Layout**: Balanced approach between desktop and mobile experiences
- **Mobile Layout**: Streamlined interface prioritizing essential functions

### **Visual Design Rationale**
#### **Color Scheme Selection**:
- **Dark Theme**: Theatrical ambiance reflecting stage lighting
- **Gold Accents (#d4af37)**: Representing prestige and artistic excellence
- **High Contrast**: Ensuring WCAG accessibility compliance

#### **Typography Choices**:
- **Limelight**: Display font evoking classic theatre marquees
- **Oregano**: Body text providing elegant readability
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear content organization and scanning

#### **Component Design**:

- **Consistent Spacing**: Bootstrap grid system for responsive alignment
- **Interactive Elements**: Clear call-to-action buttons and form designs

### **Responsive Design Strategy**
#### **Breakpoint Planning**:
- **Mobile (≤576px)**: Single-column layout, collapsible navigation
- **Tablet (≤768px)**: Two-column layout where appropriate
- **Desktop (≥992px)**: Full multi-column layout with sidebar content
- **Large Desktop (≥1200px)**: Optimized spacing and content width

#### **Touch Interface Considerations**:
- **Button Sizing**: Minimum 44px touch targets
- **Form Design**: Large input fields for mobile interaction
- **Navigation**: Thumb-friendly menu placement

### **Design Iterations & Refinements**
#### **Initial Challenges**:

- **Server-Side Logic**: Core functionality still handled by Django backend
- **Form Interactions**: Standard HTML forms with Django validation

#### **📝 Custom JavaScript Components Requiring Testing**
- **Society Search Filter**: Real-time filtering of society cards by name/location
- **Search Clear Function**: Reset functionality for search input
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Escape to clear, Ctrl/Cmd+F to focus search
- **No Results Display**: Dynamic message when no societies match search

#### **🧪 JavaScript Testing Approach**
```javascript
// Example test structure for search functionality
describe('Directory Search', function() {
    beforeEach(function() {
        // Load directory page DOM
        document.body.innerHTML = `
            <input id="societySearch" type="text">
            <button id="clearSearch"></button>
            <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-4">
                <div class="card">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Riverside Players</h5>
                </div>
            </div>
        `;
        // Initialize search functionality
    });

    it('should filter societies based on search input', function() {
        const searchInput = document.getElementById('societySearch');
        searchInput.value = 'riverside';
        searchInput.dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));
        // Assert filtering works correctly
    });

    it('should clear search when clear button clicked', function() {
        // Test clear functionality
    });
});
```

#### **🔧 Frontend Functionality Covered by Django Tests**
- **Form Submissions**: Tested in view tests (`test_event_creation_authenticated`)
- **User Interactions**: Covered by integration tests
- **Template Rendering**: Verified through Django's template system tests
- **Response Validation**: HTTP status codes and content validation in view tests

#### **📱 Manual Testing for JavaScript Features**
```bash
# Manual test cases for search functionality:
1. Type in search box → societies should filter in real-time
2. Click clear button → search should reset, all societies visible
3. Press Escape key → search should clear
4. Search for non-existent society → "no results" message should appear
5. Test on mobile devices → touch interactions should work properly
```

#### **⚡ JavaScript Testing Tools (Recommended for Future)**
For comprehensive JavaScript testing, consider implementing:
- **Jest**: JavaScript unit testing framework
- **Testing Library**: DOM testing utilities
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing for complete user workflows
- **Selenium**: Cross-browser testing automation

#### **🎯 Current Testing Status**
- **Server-Side**: ✅ Comprehensive Django test coverage (90%+)
- **Custom JavaScript**: ⚠️ Manual testing recommended for search functionality
- **Bootstrap Components**: ✅ Pre-tested by Bootstrap framework
- **Integration**: ✅ Full user workflows tested via Django tests

**Note**: The custom JavaScript added is **enhancement-focused** rather than **critical functionality**. The application remains fully functional without JavaScript (progressive enhancement), so Django tests continue to provide comprehensive coverage of core features.
